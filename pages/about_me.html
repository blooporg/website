            <h3>Refund Policy:</h3>

            <p>We want our users to have a positive experience on Bloop. If you are dissatisfied with any purchased services, such as courses or versions, you have the option to request a refund. Our Refund Policy is designed to provide a fair and transparent process for users who wish to seek a refund for services they find unsatisfactory.</p>
            
            <h3>Eligibility for Refund:</h3>
            <p>To be eligible for a refund, users must submit a refund request within 15 days of the purchase date. Refund requests made after this period will not be considered. The 15-day window ensures users have ample time to evaluate and decide if the purchased services meet their expectations.</p>
            
            <h3>Refund Process:</h3>
            <p>To initiate a refund, please contact our support team with your refund request, providing details such as the service purchased, purchase date, and a brief explanation of why you are seeking a refund.

            <h3>Exceptions to Refund:</h3>
            <p>Refunds are generally issued for dissatisfaction with courses or versions. However, certain exceptions may apply. Refunds will not be granted for services that have been substantially consumed or completed, or if there is evidence of misuse or abuse of the refund policy.</p>
            
            <h3>Refund Processing Time:</h3>
            <p>Once your refund request is approved, the processing time may vary based on the payment method used. We strive to process refunds promptly, but it may take a few business days for the refunded amount to reflect in your account.</p>
            
            <h3>Contact Information:</h3>
