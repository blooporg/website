### Scope
This Code of Conduct applies to all community spaces, including but not limited to, GitHub repositories, mailing lists, and any online or offline events. It also applies to one-on-one communications and any actions taken on behalf of the community.

### Our Pledge
In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming community, we pledge to ensure that participation in our project and our community is a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

### Our Standards
We expect all community members to act in a way that promotes a positive and welcoming environment. This includes:

- Using welcoming and inclusive language.
- Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences.
- Showing empathy towards other community members.
- Focusing on what is best for the community.
- Avoiding the use of sexualized language or imagery.

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

- Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks.
- Public or private harassment.
- Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic address, without explicit permission.

### Responsibilities
Project maintainers have the responsibility to clarify the standards of acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

### Reporting Unacceptable Behavior
If you experience or witness unacceptable behavior, or have any other concerns, please report it by contacting us. All reports will be handled with discretion.

### Consequences of Unacceptable Behavior
Unacceptable behavior from any community member, including project maintainers, will not be tolerated. Anyone asked to stop unacceptable behavior is expected to comply immediately. Failure to do so can result in temporary ban or permanent expulsion from the community.

### Addressing Grievances
If you feel you have been falsely or unfairly accused of violating this Code of Conduct, you should notify the project team with a concise description of your grievance.

### Changes to this Code of Conduct
Bloop project maintainers reserve the right to modify or replace this Code of Conduct at any time, and changes will be communicated to the community.
